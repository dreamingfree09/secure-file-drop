## 2025-12-24 – Project initialisation

Context:
The repository was created and moved to a non-synchronised local path for stability. Initial documentation and folder structure were added to anchor scope and progress tracking.

Notes:
- Git initialised
- Project structure created (docs/, journal/, cmd/, internal/, web/)
- Documentation baseline established (README, SPEC, TRACKER)
